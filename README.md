# Kubernetes 101

In this workshop, you’ll learn the basics of Kubernetes and how to orchestrate containers across a variety of cloud platforms. We will illuminate why this technology is used, and the specific history of VMs, containers, and cloud architecture that has led to its necessity. From there, we will introduce key concepts and tools for using Kubernetes. By the end of the workshop, students will be able to deploy a web application using Kubernetes. 

This is a great skill to learn for anybody interested in software operations, data science, infrastructure engineering, building a Continuous Integration pipeline, or starting a tech company.
